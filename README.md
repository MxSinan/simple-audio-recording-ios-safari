 Simple Audio Recording using RecordRTC for a web app on iOS headless browser)


Hi Muaz,

I have implemented the Simple Audio Recording using RecordRTC for a web app on iOS.
After the implementation I made a shortcut to iOS desktop, an app icon appeared to the web app. When opening this in a headless browser I got a popup: "this browser does not supprts webrtc getusermedia API. Which seems very strange to me, once i visit the demo page in iOS safari it does work.

Any idea what the cause could be of htis?

is the headless browser running other version of safari or so?

Is there are working solution in headless browsers?
